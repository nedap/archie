# ADL Checker

Give this a directory of ADL files and it will run the Archetype validation on each file. It will then print the results to standard output

To run, put your archetypes in a subdirectory called 'archetypes'. Then type:

```./gradlew run```

Currently only works with openEHR-RM, so no CIMI yet, but that is in the works. So watch this space for future changes
