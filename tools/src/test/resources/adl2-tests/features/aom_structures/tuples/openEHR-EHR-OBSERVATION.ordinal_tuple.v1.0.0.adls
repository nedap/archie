			purpose = <"Example of a tuple used to model an 'ordinal' reference model concept. The latter is one in which there is logically a 2-column list of {value, symbol} pairs (the value is typically an Integer). The tuple constraint provides a nice way to model this, by limiting the possible pairs (mostly meaningless) to just those that make sense in the domain.">
