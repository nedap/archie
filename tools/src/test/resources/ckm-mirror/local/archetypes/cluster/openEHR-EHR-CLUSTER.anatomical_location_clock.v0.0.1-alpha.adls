In practice, some archetypes carry a single data element for carrying a simple description of body site - for example, OBSERVATION.blood_pressure and CLUSTER.symptom when describing ear pain. In this situation, where the value set is predictable and simple to define, this single data element is a very accurate and pragmatic way to record the site in the body and to query at a later date. However in the situation where the anatomical location is not well defined or needs to be determined at run-time, it may be more flexible to use this structured archetype.

This archetype is specifically designed to be used within the context of any appropriate ENTRY or CLUSTER archetypes which supply the context of the identified body site, or nesting within the CLUSTER.anatomical_location archetype's 'Alternative Structure SLOT.'

In the situation where the CLUSTER.anatomical_location can only be used to name a large and/or non-specific body part, the use of this archetype within the 'Alternative Structure' SLOT will support recording of a more precise location - for example, a haemorrhoid located at 7 o'clock, where the 12 o'clock referenct point is the perineum with the patient in the lithotomy position.">
