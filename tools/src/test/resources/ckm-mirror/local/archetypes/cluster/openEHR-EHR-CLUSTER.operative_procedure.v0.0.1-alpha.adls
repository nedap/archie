This archetype is designed to be nested within the 'Procedure detail' SLOT within the ACTION.procedure archetype or similar, which will identifiy the name of the procedure and information that is common to all types of procedures.

Other CLUSTER archetypes can be inserted into the SLOTs to extend this generic archetype to capture further details for the identified operation - for example: CLUSTER.surgical_preparation; CLUSTER.myringoplasty and CLUSTER.closure.">
