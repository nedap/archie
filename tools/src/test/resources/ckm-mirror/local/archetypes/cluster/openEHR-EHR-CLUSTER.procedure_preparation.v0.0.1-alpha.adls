This archetype is designed to be nested within the 'Procedure detail' SLOT within the ACTION or INSTRUCTION.procedure archetype or similar, which will identify the name of the procedure and information that is common to all types of procedures. 

Other CLUSTER archetypes can be inserted into the SLOTs to extend this generic archetype to catpure further details about the preparative aspects for a specific procedure for example shaving. 

Scope: This archetype is specifically designed to be used to capture deails about physiological preparation of the human body in readiness for a procedure. ">
