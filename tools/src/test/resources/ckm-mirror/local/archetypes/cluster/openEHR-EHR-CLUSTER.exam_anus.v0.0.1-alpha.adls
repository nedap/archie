			use = <"Use to record a narrative description of the overall findings observed during the physical examination of the anus. This initial draft archetype consists only of the core examination pattern data elements (as per CLUSTER.exam_pattern) and will likely be expanded further over time as specific clinical requirements are identified.

This archetype has been specifically designed to be used in the 'Examination detail' SLOT within the OBSERVATION.exam archetype, but can also be used within other OBSERVATION or CLUSTER archetypes, where clinically appropriate.

Use to provide a framework in which CLUSTER archetypes can be nested in the 'Examination findings' SLOT to record additional structured physical examination findings. 

The CLUSTER.exclusion_exam archetype can be nested within the 'Examination not done' SLOT to optionally record explicit details about the examination not being performed.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of clinical findings within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Clinical Description' data element.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used for recording data not related to the physical examination of anus.

Not to be used for recording the clinical history - use specific OBSERVATION and CLUSTER archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.story and CLUSTER.symptom.

Not to be used to record stand-alone clinical observations or measurements or test results - use specific OBSERVATION archetypes. For example OBSERVATION.blood_pressure or OBSERVATION.imaging_exam.">
