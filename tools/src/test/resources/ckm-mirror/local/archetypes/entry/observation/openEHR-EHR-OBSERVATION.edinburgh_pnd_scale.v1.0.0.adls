			purpose = <"To detect depression in women who are pregnant or have recently had a baby. Developed by Cox JL, Holden JM and Sagovsky R 1987 (See references).

Internationally, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is the most widely accepted screening instrument used in the perinatal period. The EPDS was designed to allow screening of postnatal depression in the primary care setting1. It excludes some symptoms that are common in the perinatal period (tiredness, sleep disturbance, irritability) that other depression instruments include, as such symptoms do not differentiate between depressed and non-depressed postnatal women.

The value of the EPDS lies in the fact that it is easy to complete, has been validated in relation to other standardized psychiatric
measures and has been found to be acceptable to women who are asked to complete it. Its use provides women with the
opportunity to discuss their feelings and enables health professionals to discreetly raise the issue of postnatal depression.">
			use = <"As a screening instrument, the EPDS should only be used to assess a woman’s mood over the past seven (7) days. High scores
do not themselves confirm a depressive illness and, similarly, some women who score below a set threshold might have depression.
Thus, the EPDS does not provide a clinical diagnosis of depression and it should not be used as a substitute for full psychiatric
assessment or clinical judgement. Importantly the EPDS cannot be used to predict whether or not a respondent will experience
depression in the future - it can only be used to determine current mood.

There is consensus in the literature that women with scores
consistently ≥13 have a 60-100% probability of meeting diagnostic criteria for depression.">
