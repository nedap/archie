The 'Clinical Description' data element can be used to record simple narrative summary or as a means to integrate legacy data. 

Detailed, structured visual acuity results are preferred and are generally recorded for each eye in turn.  Visual acuity may be recorded using a number of different notation formats e.g. Snellen, logMar, EDTRS etc. In some settings the visual acuity result, originally captured using one of the standard  notations, is converted to a 'Derived Score' capable of algorithmic conversion to the other notations., with details of the original notation and algorithm employed recorded as part of protocol.

Where visual acuity is recorded using coded terms such as 'Visual Acuity 6/6' or 'Jaeger score N1', the 'Clinical Interpretation' element should be used, allowing the result to be captured for each eye. 'Overall Interpretation' should be used where the interpretation applies to both eyes or the test result as a whole.

The 'Absent Test Result' element may be used to record circumstances where a test could not be performed or completed. Further details may be recorded under 'Confounding Factors' or 'Additional Comment'.

When performing visual acuity testing it is customary to record a series of tests sharing a common charting methodology but with different phases of corrective refraction e.g. Unaided, Usual correction, Best corrected visual acuity etc. Each of these phases should be recorded using a separate Entry record, with the name of the test phase carried in 'Test Name'. Further specific details of the exact correction applied (which may involve applying multiple refractions) may be captured in 'Refractive Correction' and 'Refraction Details'  the latter making use of separate Cluster archetypes, one for each eye.">
