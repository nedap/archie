This archetype is to be used to record information about both current and previous alcohol use behaviour.

The specific scope of this archetype is on documentation about the use of all types of consumed alcohol because of the associated health risks.

The 'Per type' cluster of data elements allows for recording of specific details and episodes about each type of alcoholic beverage used and can be repeated once per type. The list of alcoholic beverages listed in the 'Per type' run-time name constraint identifies the alcoholic beverage. This name constraint can be applied during template modelling or at run-time within a software application.

In some situations the individual will only consume one type of alcoholic beverage, such as beer.  If other types of alcoholic beverages are used, the details will be recorded in another instance of the 'Per type' cluster.

The history of waxing and waning of use for each type of alcoholic beverage over time can be captured using the repeatable 'Per episode' cluster. This cluster of data elements allows for a very detailed pattern of alcohol use behaviour to be recorded for each type of alcoholic beverage consumed such as daily beer drinking, alongside weekly wine drinking every Friday night and occasional liquor drinking while. 

Triggers for closing one episode and commencing a new one will largely reflect local data collection preferences, including if the individual: 
- quits for a significant period of time (which will likely be locally defined); or
- significantly changes their amount of use or pattern of their alcohol consumption.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of alcohol use habits within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Overall description' data element.">
