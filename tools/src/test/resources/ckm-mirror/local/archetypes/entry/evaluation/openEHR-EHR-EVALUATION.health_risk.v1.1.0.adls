This archetype has been deliberately left open and broad in scope. The 'Health Risk' could be determined from risk factors from any or all of: medical; biomarker; lifestyle; social; occupational hazard; or environmental domains.

The intent of this archetype is to document potential risk at a point in time, and to support decision-making that may reduce the identified risk, whether by clinicians or the individual themselves.">
