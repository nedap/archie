In practice, the terms 'heart rate' and 'pulse rate' are often used interchangeably, although they may be measured at different body sites. This archetype allows either term to be used when the measurement site is not specified, to suit clinician preferences.

Use to record the measurement of the pulse rate, or heart rate, observations about the associated pattern and character, and clinical interpretation of the findings.

Measurements such as the maximum pulse or heart rate over an interval of time can be recorded using 'Maximum' event. Others point-in-time or interval events may be specified within a template or at run-time.

In development of this archetype, there has been some tension around representation of the regularity of the pulse or heart beat. This archetype represents the relevant data points separately: firstly establishing 'Regular' vs 'Irregular' and then, if 'Irregular', further options of 'Regularly irregular' and 'Irregularly irregular'. In practice, clinical systems could offer users a combination of the values from the 'Regular?' and 'Irregular type' - for example, 'Regular', 'Regularly irregular' and 'Irregularly irregular' drawn from these two data elements. Data could be recorded against both data elements with the assumption that if one of the irregular types are selected, then the 'Irregular' value in the 'Regular?' data element is also automatically selected.

In certain situations it is important to be very specific so that a rate observed at a peripheral body site, such as the radial artery, can be differentiated from the rate of the heart. To record a pulse deficit, record the measurements of the mechanical heart rate and a peripheral pulse rate in two instances of this archetype - the difference between these measurments is the pulse deficit. The actual pulse deficit will be recorded in a separate OBSERVATION archetype.">
