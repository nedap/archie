For some categries of recording e.g Build - weight for height, only a single score can be selected. For others e.g. Skin type Visual Risk areas, more than one risk can be entered to contribute to the overall score. 
Some categories have overall limits e.g.  although mutiple Neurological deficits can be recorded , the total score for all such risks cannot exceed 6. 
Some centres expect only a total to be recorded for a whole category in which case, individual risk elements should not be captured.">
