不同的商品化试纸条备有多种多样的测试块/反应区。本原始型在很大程度上受到了澳大利亚常见的Multistix试纸条的影响，用于记录常用的10种分析物，但本原始型还是旨在做到广泛适用。为了满足其他试纸条的需要，如果关于其他参数的需求变得明显起来，则可能就需要编制产品特异性的尿液分析原始型。">

Different commercial products carry a variety of test /reagent pads. This archetype is heavily influenced by the commonly available Multistix test strips in Australia, recording ten commonly used analytes, but is intended to be generically applicable. If requirements for other parameters become apparent to meet the requirements for other test strips then product-specific urinalysis archetypes may need to be developed.">
