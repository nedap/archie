Please note: There is some apparent overlap between the 'Physical activity category' data element in this archetype and the 'Physical activity level (PAL) status' data element in EVALUATION.physical_activity_summary archetype - they both use the same value set. Use this archetype when recording the category at a specified point in time or during a specified period of time, however if the intent is to record the typical activity as a summative statement then use the equivalent data point in the EVALUATION.physical_activity_summary.

It is anticipated that this archetype will be further enhanced to record activity-specific data.">
