It is anticipated that each COMPOSITION.report-procedure archetype will contain at least one ACTION.procedure (or related archetype) but depending on the complexity of the procedure it may contain a variety of other archetypes depending on the nature and complexity of the procedure performed. For example, archetypes to describe the associated anaesthetic or imaging activities carried out during the procedure.

Common use cases are: 
- any procedure that is not recorded as part of a consultation but needs to be carried out recorded as a stand-alone activity; 
- Endoscopy Report; through to a 
- complete Operation Report for an laparotomy or joint replacement.

Record of the anaesthetic used to cover the procedure will be recorded using purpose-specific archetypes. They can be committed to the health record at the same time as the Procedure report, most likely in one of two ways:
- in a separate Anaesthetic report. This is most likely if the anaesthetic is administered by a separate clinician to the one performing the procedure; or
- in the same Procedure report as the procedure is recorded. This is most likely if the anaesthetic was administered by the same clinician who performed the procedure.

The Sections component has been deliberately left unconstrained to maximise re-use of this archetype.">

Not to be used for procedures that are recorded as part of a consultation note, for example removal of a skin lesion in a primary care consultation - use a ACTION.procedure archetype inside the COMPOSITION.encouter for this purpose.

Not to be used for procedures that are recorded as part of a nursing progress note, for example insertion of a catheter - use an ACTION.procedure archetype inside the COMPOSITION.progress_note.">
