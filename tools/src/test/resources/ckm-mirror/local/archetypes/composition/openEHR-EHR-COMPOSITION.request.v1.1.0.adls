This document will typically include details about the scope and duration of validity of the request, as well as relevant clinical information about the subject. Requests can vary from a simple request for a consultation, seeking recommendation about further action, requesting a specific procedure or diagnostic test, through to full handover of care and clinical responsibility to the receiving healthcare provider.

Use cases include, but are not limited to a request for:
- a consultation, second opinion or management advice from a specialist;
- a diagnostic test;
- home care from visiting nurses;
- transfer of care to a rehabilitation facility;
- for aged care assessment;
- for a medication review by a pharmacist; and
- for provision of physiotherapy or occupational therapy.

Requests may be targeted (identifying a specific healthcare provider or organisation to carry out the request) or untargeted (identifying only the type of care desired).">
