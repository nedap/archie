This archetype has been designed to be nested inside the OBSERVATION.exam archetype (and its specialisations) or other relevant CLUSTER archetypes. For example, this archetype may be used as one component of a complete record of a bimanual pelvic examination - either nested within, or placed alongside, CLUSTER.palpation_of_uterus, as required by the specific clinical scenario being modelled.">
