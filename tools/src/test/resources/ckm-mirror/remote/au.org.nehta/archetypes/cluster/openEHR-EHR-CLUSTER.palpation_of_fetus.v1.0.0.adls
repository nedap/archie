This archetype has been designed to be nested inside the OBSERVATION.exam archetype or other relevant CLUSTER archetypes, for example providing specific detail about the fetus in CLUSTER.palpation_of_uterus.

Record the details of only one fetus using this archetype. Recording details about multiple fetuses will require the multiple separate instances of this archetype.">
