It is also possible to record family history information for individuals other than the subject of the health record - for example information about the father of an unborn fetus needs to be stored in the mother's health record until birth. In this situation the subject of care must be explicitly specified.

The intent of this COMPOSITION is for use as a persistent summary, however it has been identified that for implementation the archetype also needs additional attributes related to the context of the event. As a result, the COMPOSITION has been temporarily modified as an EVENT COMPOSITION which allows addition of an Items SLOT into which additional context-related archetypes can be included. This new requirement for context-related attributes in the Persistent COMPOSITION has been requested as a future openEHR Reference Model update.">
