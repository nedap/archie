The scope of this record can includes, but is not limited to:
- an overview of smoking and tobacco use;
- an overview of alcohol consumption;
- an overview of substance use;
- an overview of physical activity;
- an overview of diet and nutrition; and when relevant,
- an overview of sexual history.

The intent of this COMPOSITION is for use as a persistent summary, however it has been identified that for implementation the archetype also needs additional attributes related to the context of the event. As a result, the COMPOSITION has been temporarily modified as an EVENT COMPOSITION which allows addition of an Items SLOT into which additional context-related archetypes can be included. This new requirement for context-related attributes in the Persistent COMPOSITION has been requested as a future openEHR Reference Model update.

Initial design of this archetype was funded by the iCareNet Antenatal Shared Care Plan project, Northern Territory, Australia.">
