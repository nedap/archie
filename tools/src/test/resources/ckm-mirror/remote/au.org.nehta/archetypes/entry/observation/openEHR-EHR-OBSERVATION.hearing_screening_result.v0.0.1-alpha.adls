Use to record the outcome of all responses to hearing screening (or Screening Outcome). 

This archetype has been designed to capture screening assessment for hearing, using pass/fail criteria, for the following tests:
- Pure Tone Audiometry;
- Play Audiometry;
- Automated Auditory Brainstem Response; and
- Visual Reinforcement Orientation Audiometry.

All of the data elements are recorded using a single method or protocol. If, during the test, any of the protocol parameters need to be modified, then the subsequent part of the test will need to be recorded within a separate instance of the test data, using the updated protocol parameters.">

			misuse = <"Not to be used for hearing threshold assessment - use the OBSERVATION.audiogram archetype.

Not to be used to record other auditory assessments such as:
- Behavioural Observation Audiometry (BOA);
- Most Comfortable Listening Level (MCL) and Uncomfortable Listening Level (UCL);
- Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) for diagnostic purposes
- Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE); and
- Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE).
These assessments need to be recorded in specific archetypes for the purpose.">
