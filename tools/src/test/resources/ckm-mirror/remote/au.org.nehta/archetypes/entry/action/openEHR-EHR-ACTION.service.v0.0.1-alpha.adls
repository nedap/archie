			use = <"Use to record information about the execution of a request for a health-related service. This is done by recording relevant data against any or all of activities specified in the 'Planned', 'Scheduled', 'Active', 'Suspended', 'Cancelled', 'Postponed', 'Aborted' pathway steps.

The scope of this archetype deliberately encompasses activities for a broad range of clinical services. Examples include, but are not limited to:
- self-referral by a patient for a check-up visit to a dentist for preventive care or a series of visits to a physiotherapist for management of a musculoskeletal strain; and
- a referral from a requesting healthcare provider, such as a primary care clinician, to a receiving healthcare provider, such as a specialist, for the patient to receive a specific service, advice or care.

Additional structured and detailed information about the service can be captured using purpose-specific archetypes inserted into the 'Service detail' slot, where required.

Timings related to a procedure can be managed in one of two ways:
- using the reference model - the time for performance of any pathway step will use the ACTION time attribute for each step; and
- using the archetyped data - the 'Scheduled date/time' data element is intended to record the precise time when the service is planned. Note: the corresponding ACTION time attribute for the Scheduled pathway step will record the time that the service was scheduled into a system, not the intended date/time on which the service is intended to be carried out.

In practice, some services (for example, in ambulatory care) will occur once and not be ordered in advance. The details about the service will be added against the pathway step, 'Service completed'. In some cases a recurring service will be ordered, and in this situation data against the 'Service delivered' step will be recorded on each occasion, leaving the instruction in the active state. When the last delivery of the service is recorded, the 'Service completed' action is recorded showing that this order is now in the completed state.

In other situations, such as secondary care, there may be a formal order for a procedure using a corresponding INSTRUCTION.request archetype. This ACTION archetype can then be used to record the workflow of when and how the order has been carried out.

This archetype may only be used in two ways:
- as a full record of the service that was delivered; or
- as a framework to record primarily the state of the requested service, with separate OBSERVATION archetypes used to record the actual test results for the delivered service - for example OBSERVATION.hearing_screening_result.

Recording information using this ACTION archetype indicates that some sort of activity has actually occurred; this will usually be the service delivery itself but may be a failed attempt or another activity such as postponement of the service delivery. If there is a formal order for the procedure, the state of this order is represented by the Pathway step against which the data is recorded. For example, using this archetype the progressing state of a referral request may be recorded through separate entries in the EHR progress notes at each 'Pathway' step:
- record the scheduled Start date/time for the referral (Service scheduled); and
- record that the referral has been completed, potentially including information about the service delivered (Service completed).

Please note that in the openEHR Reference Model there is a 'Time' attribute, which is intended to record the date and time at which each pathway step of the Action was performed. This is the attribute to use to record the start of the procedure (using the 'Service delivered' pathway step) or the time that the service was aborted (using the 'Service abandoned' pathway step).">
