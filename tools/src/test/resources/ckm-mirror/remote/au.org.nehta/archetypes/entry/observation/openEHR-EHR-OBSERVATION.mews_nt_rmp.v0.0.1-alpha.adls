MEWS is based on data derived from four physiological readings (systolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, body temperature) and one observation (level of consciousness) which are compared to normal ranges. The score for each parameter is added to generate a single composite score.

From the NT Remote Health Atlas: 
\"Response: 
- Score < 3: DMO continues management as appropriate. 
- Score 3 – 5: ED consultant should be notified if DMO has any concerns. 
- Score > 5: ED consultant must be notified immediately. ED consultant should consider speaking directly to referrer. Plan evacuation with Retrieval MO escort, Priority 1 or 2.\"

Different MEWS are in use in different jurisdictions in Australia and in other parts of the world. This version of MEWS is mandated for use by the Remote Medical Practitioner On-Call service in the Northern Territory, Australia to support remote clincians to determine the degree of illness in a unseen patient and the need for emergency retrieval.">
