			purpose = <"To record measurements based on a 226 Hz probe tone, of the admittance or impedance of the middle ear system as a function of changing the external ear canal pressure.

To infer middle ear function from objective measurements based on a fixed 226Hz probe tone, taken at the tympanic membrane of the mobility of the tympanic membrane, in reponse to varying air pressure in the ear canal.">
			use = <"Use to record measurements taken during tympanometry with a 226 Hz probe tone.

Use to record outcome of tympanometry screening based on 226 Hz probe tone tympanometry.

Use to record the interpretation all tympanogram measurements taken with a 226 Hz probe tone, to infer middle ear function for each ear, plus an overall interpretation (or tympanometric diagnosis). 

All of the data elements are recorded using a single method or protocol. If, during the test, any of the protocol parameters need to be modified, then the subsequent part of the test will need to be recorded within a separate instance of the test data, using the updated protocol parameters.

Each 'Pressure vs Compliance Measurement' pair will comprise one pressure measurment with one corresponding compliance measurement. Compliance measurement has been represented in the archetype twice, each with different units. Compliance measurements will only be recorded in data using the unit that is recorded by the tympanometer in use - either volume units OR conductance units, but not both.

Similarly, Static Compliance has been represented in the archetype twice, each with different units. Static Compliance measurements will only be recorded in data using the unit that is recorded by the tympanometer in use - either volume units OR conductance units, but not both.

If the tympanogram subtypes are to be used in an implementation, these should be substituted for the global Type B category in the 'Tympanogram Type' data element. Both 'Type B' and 'Type B - low/high compliance' should not be used in the same implementation. 'Type B - low complicance' is equivalent to the unqualified 'Type B' in the 'Tympanogram Type' data element. 

Similarly, if Type C subtypes describing the Tympanogram curve are to be used in an implementation, these should be substituted for the global Type C category in the 'Tympanogram Type' data element. Both Type C and Types C1-3 should not be used in the same implementation.">
