The generic structures are as follows. \n  Single:   single items, used to contain any single value, such as a height or weight. \n  List:       linear lists of named items, such as many pathology test results. \n  Table:    tabular data, including unlimited and limited length tables with named and \n               ordered columns, and potentially named rows. \n  Tree:     tree-shaped data, which may be conceptually a list of lists, or other deep structure. \n  History: time-series structures, where each time-point can be an entire data structure \n               of any complexity, described by one of the above structure types. Point and interval \n               samples are supported. \n",
