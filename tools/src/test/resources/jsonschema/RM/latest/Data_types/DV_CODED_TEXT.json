    "description": "A text item whose value must be the rubric from a controlled terminology, the key (i.e. the 'code') of which is the `_defining_code_` attribute. In other words: a `DV_CODED_TEXT` is a combination of a `CODE_PHRASE` (effectively a code) and the rubric of that term, from a terminology service, in the language in which the data were authored. \n\nSince `DV_CODED_TEXT` is a subtype of `DV_TEXT`, it can be used in place of it, effectively allowing the type `DV_TEXT` to mean  a text item, which may optionally be coded. \n\nMisuse: If the intention is to represent a term code attached in some way to a fragment of plain text, `DV_CODED_TEXT` should not be used; instead use a `DV_TEXT` and a `TERM_MAPPING` to a `CODE_PHRASE`.
